<font size=5>Welcome</font> to GCC-XML, the XML output extension to GCC!

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Development tools that work with programming languages benefit
      from their ability to understand the code with which they work
      at a level comparable to a compiler. C++ has become a popular
      and powerful language, but parsing it is a very challenging
      problem. This has discouraged the development of tools meant to
      work directly with the language.
    <p>
      There is one C++ parser, the C++ front-end to GCC, which is
      currently able to deal with the language in its entirety. The
      purpose of the GCC-XML extension is to generate an XML
      description of a C++ program from GCC's internal
      representation. Since XML is easy to parse, other development
      tools will be able to work with C++ programs without the burden
      of a complicated C++ parser.

<P>
GCC-XML was developed by Brad King at <a href="http://www.kitware.com">Kitware</a>
to be used by CABLE, which was developed as part of the <a
href="http://public.kitware.com/Insight/Web/index.htm">NLM Insight Segmentation and
Registration Toolkit</a> project.
