    <font size=5>Running </font> GCC-XML has the goal of providing
        an XML description of your code as it is seen by the compiler
        when it is built.  This means that GCC-XML should make use of
        the same standard library and other headers as your compiler.
        The hard part about running GCC-XML involves determining the
        set of -I and -D options it needs to use the headers from the
        compiler of your choice.
        <p>
        Finding the set of options needed is different for each compiler
        with which GCC-XML can be used.  See below for compiler-specific
        instructions.
        There are some options that are always needed since the executable
        is really GCC's C++ front-end.  These options are
        "<code>-quiet -nostdinc -o /dev/null -w -fsyntax-only</code>".
        Any additional macro definitions
        you give to your compiler as part of building your code should
        be added to these when running GCC-XML.
        <p>
        Some of the instructions below involve running a UNIX shell
        script to find the flags needed for GCC-XML to work with your
        compiler.  The scripts actually run the compiler in verbose
        mode and select macro definitions and include path options
        from the output.  Before running the scripts, you should set
        the <code>CXXFLAGS</code> environment variable to the value it
        would hold if you were compiling your source instead of
        parsing it with GCC-XML.

        <h2>GCC</h2>
        The GCC support library is installed with the
        "<code>install_gcc</code>" makefile target.  See the <a
        href="/GCC_XML/HTML/Install.html">Install</a> page for details
        about installing it.  There is a UNIX shell script called
        <code>find_gcc_options</code> in the <code>GccInclude</code>
        subdirectory in the support library installation.  Running
        this script should find the options that you need to use
        GCC-XML with any version of GCC.  GCC-XML currently does not
        require a -I option adding the GccInclude directory to the
        beginning of the include search path because there are no
        special headers that override system headers.  This may change
        in the future, however.

        <h2>MipsPro</h2>
        The MipsPro support library is installed with the
        "<code>install_mpro</code>" makefile target.  See the <a
        href="/GCC_XML/HTML/Install.html">Install</a> page for details
        about installing it.  There is a UNIX shell script called
        <code>find_mpro_options</code> in the <code>MproInclude</code>
        subdirectory in the support library installation.  Running
        this script should find the options that you need to use
        GCC-XML with versions of MipsPro.  It has been tested with
        variants of version 7.3.  GCC-XML will require a -I option
        adding the MproInclude directory to the beginning of the
        include search path.

        <h2>Visual C++ 6.0 Service Pack 5 (also Intel C++)</h2>
        The standard headers provided in the <code>VC98/Include</code>
        directory by Microsoft cannot be used directly by GCC-XML
        because they actually contain illegal C++ code (according to
        ISO C++ Standard).  To get around this problem, the
        pre-compiled binary installation program finds your copy of
        Visual C++.  Some of its headers are copied to a folder called
        VcInclude in the GCC_XML installation directory.  The copies
        are then patched to correct the invalid code.  The VcInclude
        directory will also contain a file called FLAGS.txt which has
        the set of options you need to give to GCC-XML.

        <h2>Example of running GCC-XML</h2>
        <p>
        Run gccxml with the <code>-fxml=</code>some-file-name flag
        (added by extension) to enable the XML output after parsing.
        Try running gcc-xml on <a href="example1.cxx">this</a> example
        source:
        <blockquote>
          <code>
            $ gccxml -quiet -nostdinc -o /dev/null -fsyntax-only example1.cxx -fxml=example1.xml
          </code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        If there are no errors, the XML description of the program
        will be written to a file with the provided name.  For this
        example, it looks like <a href="example1.xml">this</a>.  Note
        that the options used above are not sufficient for much more
        than the example given.  If any files are
        <code>#include</code>d, more options will be needed.
