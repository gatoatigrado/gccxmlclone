    <font size=5>The </font> installation process for GCC-XML is
    different on Windows and UNIX.  The Windows installation is
    simpler than in UNIX, but is also much less flexible.

    <h2>Windows</h2>
    There is a pre-compiled copy with an installation program
    available.  Refer to the
    <a href="/GCC_XML/HTML/Download.html">Download</a> page to get it.
    The installer will automatically take care of the compiler-specific
    support library installation.  Currently support is only available for
    C/C++ headers provided by Visual C++ 6.0 (tested with service pack 5).
    See the page on <a href="/GCC_XML/HTML/Running.html">Running</a> GCC-XML
    for details about this support library.

    <h2>UNIX & Cygwin</h2>
    Installation on a UNIX platform is a two-part process:
    <ol>
      <li> Installation of the GCC-XML executable.
      <li> Installation the compiler-specific support libraries.
    </ol>
    <h3>Building and Installing the GCC-XML Executable</h3>
    There are several ways to build the executable.
    <ul>
      <li> Download the pre-patched source to GCC 3.0 and build it.
           See the <a href="/GCC_XML/HTML/Download.html">Download</a> page
           to get it.  This is the recommended approach for UNIX users, and
           is detailed below.
      <li> Download the entire GCC 3.0 compiler source from
           <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GCC's web site</a>, apply the
           GCC-XML patch, and install the compiler with the extension built in.
           See the page on
           <a href="/GCC_XML/HTML/Patching_GCC.html">Patching GCC</a>
           for instructions.
      <li> Cygwin users can use the Windows installer program to get the
           binary pre-built.  When prompted for component selection, just
           disable the Visual C++ 6.0 support if you don't want it.
    </ul>
    Follow the instructions below to build the part of GCC you need to
    get the GCC-XML executable.  It is assumed that you have extracted
    the pre-patched GCC source in your home directory, so the source
    appears in <code>~/gccxml</code>.  You will build the program in a
    parallel directory called <code>~/gccxml-build</code>.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Configure and build GCC (but don't install it).  Don't bother with a bootstrap, just run
        <code>make</code> after the configuration step.  Example:
        <blockquote>
          <code>
            $ cd ~<br>
            $ mkdir gccxml-build<br>
            $ cd gccxml-build<br>
            $ ../gccxml/configure --enable-languages=c++ --disable-nls<br>
            $ make<br>
          </code>
        </blockquote>
        This example builds all of GCC's C++ compiler and its standard library,
        but all you really need is one exectuable.  If you want to try to
        build the minimal portion of GCC needed, try
       <a href="direct_build.html">these</a> instructions.
        If you want more detailed instructions about building GCC,
        go <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/install/index.html">here</a>.
      <li>
          When the build finishes, find the file
          <code>~/gccxml-build/gcc/cc1plus</code>.  This program is
          GCC's C++ front-end which is run by the <code>gcc</code>
          driver program for C++ sources.  It does not automatically
          add any preprocessor macros (like <code>__GNUC__</code>), so
          we can use it to exactly control how our source is parsed.
          This is the only part of the compiler you need, and is the
          gcc-xml executable.  Copy this program to
          <code>PREFIX/bin</code>, and rename it to
          <code>gccxml</code>.  Here, "<code>PREFIX</code>" refers to
          your GCC-XML support library installation prefix, such as
          <code>/usr/local</code> (see below).
    </ol>

    <h3>Installing the compiler-specific support libraries</h3>
    The support libraries contain scripts and headers that help you run
    GCC-XML to parse your code just as your compiler would.  See the
    page on <a href="/GCC_XML/HTML/Running.html">Running</a> GCC-XML for
    details on these libraries.
    <p>
    To install these, you will need to have a CVS checkout of GCC_XML.
    See the <a href="/GCC_XML/HTML/Download.html">Download</a> page for
    details.
    In the root directory of the GCC_XML source distribution, there is a
    Makefile whose only purpose is to install the support libraries.
    From that directory, run "<code>make</code>" for more instructions.
    The compiler support libraries you select will be installed in
    <code>PREFIX/share/GCC_XML</code>.  There will be a subdirectory
    for each supported compiler.  In many cases, you will need to add
    the appropriate subdirectory to the beginning of the include path when
    GCC-XML is run.
