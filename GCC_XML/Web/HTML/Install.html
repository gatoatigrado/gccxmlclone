    <font size=5>Install </font> GCC-XML with one of these approaches:
    <ul>
      <li> On Windows, you can use the pre-compiled installation binary.
           See the <a href="/GCC_XML/HTML/Download.html">Download</a> page
           to get it.
      <li> On UNIX, you need to build GCC-XML yourself from the pre-patched
           source to GCC 3.0.  See the
           <a href="/GCC_XML/HTML/Download.html">Download</a> page to get it.
           This is also an option for cygwin users, although the
           binary version will work.
      <li> On UNIX, you can install GCC 3.0 with the extension available
           as part of the compiler.  See the page on
           <a href="/GCC_XML/HTML/Patching_GCC.html">Patching GCC</a>
           for instructions.
    </ul>
    The rest of these instructions assume you have chosen to build
    GCC-XML yourself.  It is also assumed that you have the GCC source
    (with patch applied) in the directory <code>~/gccxml</code>.  You
    will build the program in a parallel directory called
    <code>~/gccxml-build</code>.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Configure and build GCC (but don't install it).  Go
        <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/install/index.html">here</a> for
        instructions.  Don't bother with a bootstrap, just run
        <code>make</code> after the configuration step.  Example:
        <blockquote>
          <code>
            $ cd ~<br>
            $ mkdir gccxml-build<br>
            $ cd gccxml-build<br>
            $ ../gccxml/configure --enable-languages=c++ --disable-nls<br>
            $ make<br>
          </code>
        </blockquote>
        This example builds all of GCC's C++ compiler and its standard library,
        but all you really need is one exectuable.  If you want to try to
        build the minimal portion of GCC needed, try
       <a href="direct_build.html">these</a> instructions.
      <li>
          When the build finishes, find the file
          <code>~/gccxml-build/gcc/cc1plus</code>.  This program is GCC's
          C++ front-end which is run by the standard <code>gcc</code>
          executable for C++ programs.  It does not automatically add
          any preprocessor macros (like <code>__GNUC__</code>), so we can
          use it to exactly control how our source is parsed.  This is
          the only part of the compiler you need, and is the gcc-xml
          executable.  Copy this program to wherever you want to install it,
          and rename it to <code>gccxml</code>.
